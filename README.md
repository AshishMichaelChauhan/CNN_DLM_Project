# 🧠 CNN-Based Deep Learning Project

## 🛠️ Project Overview
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to classify image data. It uses **TensorFlow/Keras** libraries within a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) environment to train and evaluate the model.

---

## 💾 Dataset
- The project uses an image dataset, processed and fed into the CNN for training and testing.
- **Dataset Features:**
  - Multiple classes of images
  - Preprocessing steps include resizing and normalization.

---

## 🚀 Model Architecture
The CNN model is built with the following configuration:
- **Input Layer:** Image data with dimensions (height, width, channels)
- **Convolutional Layers:**
  - Multiple Conv2D layers with ReLU activation
  - MaxPooling2D layers for down-sampling
- **Flattening Layer:**
  - Converts the 2D matrix into a 1D vector
- **Dense Layers:**
  - Fully connected layers with ReLU activation
  - Dropout layers for regularization
- **Output Layer:**
  - Activation: Softmax (for multiclass classification) or Sigmoid (for binary classification)
